/**
 * An "alert" is the system's **primary** data structure. An "alert" is essentially
 * a collection of ```conditions``` which the backend monitors.
 *
 * All required properties must be present to create a new alert. Once an alert has been
 * created, the backend will "fill in" any omitted properties. For example, if you create
 * an alert without a ```publishers``` property, the backend will add the property and
 * assign an empty array. This applies to all component types.
 *
 * @typedef Alert
 * @type Object
 * @memberOf Schema
 * @property {String=} alert_id - The alert's unique identifier (assigned by the backend, omit when creating a new alert).
 * @property {String=} name - The name of the alert (if not provided, the backend will attempt to generate a name).
 * @property {String} user_id - The alert owner's unique identifier.
 * @property {String} alert_system - The alert owner's domain.
 * @property {Enums.AlertState=} alert_state - The alert's current status (managed by the backend).
 * @property {Enums.AlertBehaviour=} alert_behaviour - The alert's strategy for handling state changes after its conditions are met â€”```terminate``` is the default value.
 * @property {String=} create_date - The time the alert was created (milliseconds since epoch).
 * @property {String=} last_start_date - The last time the alert was started (milliseconds since epoch).
 * @property {String=} last_trigger_date - The last time the alert was triggered (milliseconds since epoch).
 * @property {String=} user_notes - Ad hoc text.
 * @property {String=} alert_type - Used to classify the alert, controlling "default" publishing rules, if no publishers have been explicitly specified. This happens by matching the "active_alert_type" property of a {@link PublisherTypeDefault}.
 * @property {Array<Schema.Condition>} conditions - The conditions which cause an the alert to be triggered. If multiple conditions are present, they must all be satisfied before the alert will be triggered.
 * @property {Array<AlertResetSchedule>=} schedules
 * @property {Array<Publisher>=} publishers - The rules for publishing a notification. This is optional. In most cases, it's best to rely on the default rules bound to the alert's owner.
 * @property {Array<Publisher>=} effectivePublishers - A read-only property added by the backend listing the "effective" rules which will be used to publish notifications. Any rules in the "publishers" property take precedence, then the default rules for the alert's owner are applied.

/**
 * A "condition" is a statement that can be evaluated (as the backend processes streaming data).
 *
 * For example, "Apple stock's last price is higher than $600" is a condition. Using this example,
 * the "property" object denotes "Apple stock's last price" and the "operator" object denotes "higher
 * than $600."
 *
 * Only required fields are necessary to create a condition (for use with a new alert object).
 *
 * @typedef Condition
 * @type Object
 * @memberOf Schema
 * @property {String} condition_id - The condition's unique identifier (assigned by the backend).
 * @property {String=} name - The name of the condition (if not provided, the backend will attempt to generate a name).

 * @property {Schema.Operator} operator - The "operator" to use to evaluate the ```property``` (e.g. greater than).

/**
 * A "property" is an attribute of an observable object. A property refers to a {@link Target}.

 *
 * @typedef Property
 * @type Object
 * @memberOf Schema
 * @property {Number} property_id - The property's unique identifier (assigned by the backend).

 * @property {Enums.PropertyType=} type - The attribute's value type (e.g. a number or a string).
 * @property {Array<Schema.Operator>=} valid_operators - A list of operators which can be used with this {@link Schema.Property} to create a {@link Schema.Condition}. Managed by the backend.
 * @property {Array<String>=} category - A grouping container for the property. Useful when displaying a list of properties. Managed by the backend.
 * @property {Array<String>=} description - A description of the property (broken into one or more components). Managed by the backend.
 * @property {Array<String>=} descriptionShort - Similar to ```description``` but with condensed or abbreviated wording. Managed by the backend.
 * @property {Number=} sortOrder - A suggested ranking for use when displaying a list of properties. Managed by the backend.

/**
 * A "target" refers to an entire group of objects (e.g. stock quotes). When used to
 * build an alert, a target has an ```identifier``` which points to the specific object

 * refers to a specific item within the group (by using an ```identifier```).
