## Purpose

**This SDK connects your applications to the  _Barchart Alert Service_. You can define alert conditions, ask our remote service to track those conditions on your behalf, and receive immediate notifications when those conditions are met.**

Here's how it works:

* You _choose_ notification mechanism(s):
	* Receive notifications to your web service, via HTTP POST (you handle last mile)
	* Receive notifications via email
	* Receive notifications via SMS messages
	* Receive push notifications to your mobile applications (coming soon)
* You _define_ an alert. Each alert has one or more conditions, for example:
	* Apple common stock trades over $500.00 per share
	* Apple common stock achieves a new 30 high
	* A news article, mentioning Apple common stock, was just published
* You _start_ the alert:
	* Barchart's Alert Service will continuously monitor your conditions
	* Once your conditions are met, notifications are dispatched

## Sample Notifications

## Supported Environments

This SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the Barchart Alert Service. We recommend using it in JavaScript environments.

#### Web Browsers

This SDK can be distributed as part of your browser-based applications. The source code is written in [ES2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). Consequently, transpilation (with appropriate polyfills) is recommended before distribution.

#### Node.js

This SDK is compatible with Node.js.

#### Direct Access

The Barchart Alert Service implements a REST interface via HTTP. You may choose to interact with the service directly, bypassing this SDK entirely. An [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification of the interface can be found in the [API Reference](/content/api_reference) section.

#### Other

If JavaScript isn't suitable for your environment and you're not interested in direct access, please contact us at solutions@barchart.com or (866) 333-7587.

## User Privacy

Privacy is important to Barchart and we do not wish to transmit or collect personally identifiable information about your users. We encourage users of the Alerts Service to avoid sharing identifying information.

Here's how:

* Each alert is owned by a user. You must provide Barchart with unique user identifiers for your users; however, they can be meaningless â€” other to differentiate one user from another. [Universally Unique Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) are commonly used for this purpose.
* Alert notifications are delivered your users. Barchart can do this on your behalf. Alternately, we can deliver notifications to your web service. In this manner, you handle the "last mile" of delivery and eliminate the need to share contact information for your users.

Furthermore, each request to the backend is authenticated. This is done using JWT technology. You generate "tokens" and the backend verifies their authenticity. The tokens provide security; however they do not contain any sensitive information (e.g. passwords). You can read more about this in the [Key Concepts: Security]((/content/concepts/security)) section of the documentation.
