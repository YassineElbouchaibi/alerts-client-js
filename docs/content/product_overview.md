## Purpose

**This SDK connects your applications to the Barchart Alerting Service.** 

Here's how it works:

* You _define_ an alert with one or more conditions, for example:
	* Apple common stock trades over $500.00 per share
	* Apple common stock achieves a new 30-day high
	* A news article, mentioning Apple common stock, is released
* You _choose_ the notification mechanism(s):
	* Receive notifications via webhook (and you handle the last mile)
	* Receive notifications via email
	* Receive notifications via SMS messages
	* Receive notifications via push to your mobile applications
* You _start_ the alert:
	* Barchart's Alerting Service will continuously monitor your conditions
	* Once your conditions are met, notifications are dispatched
* The _Barchart Alerting Service_ continuously monitors alert conditions.
* The _Barchart Alerting Service_ dispatches notifications when alert conditions are met.

**Privacy is important to Barchart.** 

We don't want to collect or transmit any personally identifiable information. Avoid sending sending sensitive information to Barchart, as follows:

* Use meaningless identifiers for your users — as long as they are unique.
* Use cryptographic tokens which allow Barchart to verify user identity. Passwords are not necessary.
* Contact information can be withheld, if your systems handle the "last mile" of user notification.
