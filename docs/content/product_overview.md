## Purpose

**This SDK connects your applications to the Barchart Alerting Service,** which allows you to set up conditions for continuous monitoring and receive notifications when those conditions are met. 

Here's how it works:

* You _define_ an alert. Each alert has one or more conditions, for example:
	* Apple common stock trades over $500.00 per share
	* Apple common stock achieves a new 30 high
	* A news article, mentioning Apple common stock, was just published
* You _choose_ the notification mechanism(s):
	* Receive notifications via webhook (and you handle the last mile)
	* Receive notifications via email
	* Receive notifications via SMS messages
	* Receive notifications via push to your mobile applications
* You _start_ the alert:
	* Barchart's Alerting Service will continuously monitor your conditions
	* Once your conditions are met, notifications are dispatched

## Sample Notifications

## Supported Environments

This SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the Barchart Alerting Service. We recommend using it in JavaScript environments.

#### Web Browsers

This SDK can be distributed as part of your browser-based applications. The source code is written in [ES2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#9th_Edition_%E2%80%93_ECMAScript_2018). Consequently, transpilation (or polyfill use) is recommended before distribution.

#### Node.js

This SDK is compatible with Node.js.

#### Direct Access

The Barchart Alerting Service implements a REST interface over HTTP(S). By using the REST interface, you can bypass this SDK entirely. See the [API Reference](/content/api_reference) section, which contains [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification.

#### Other

If JavaScript isn't suitable for your environment, and you're not interested in direct access â€” please contact us at solutions@barchart.com or (866) 333-7587.

## User Privacy

**Privacy is important to Barchart.** We don't want to transmit or collect personally identifiable information for your users.

Avoid sharing identifying information, as follows:

* Each alert has an owner. You must provide Barchart with a way to distinguish one owner from another. However, identity can be concealed by using meaningless identifiers.
* Authorization is handled using JSON Web Tokens. These tokens provide security without the need for passwords.
* Notifications can be handled entirely by your systems (via webhooks). In this scenario, Barchart will not require contact infomation for your users.
