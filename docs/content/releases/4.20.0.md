**New Features**

* Each time an alert is triggered, a persistent ```Trigger``` object is created.
* Queries for ```Trigger``` objects are now supported.
* Subscriptions for ```Trigger``` creation, mutation, and deletion was added.
* The status of a ```Trigger``` can be updated, between read/unread.

**Technical Enhancements**

* The `JwtPayload.forSigning` function will not emit an object which uses standard Barchart properties (i.e. `userId` instead of `user_id` and `contextId` instead of `alert_system`).
* The `getJwtGenrator` function no longer signs tokens. Instead, it delegates token signing to a web service.
* The `refreshInterval` parameter of the `JwtProvider` constructor is now optional.
* The `JwtProvider` now applies some jitter to the `refreshInterval` parameter.

**Other**

* The [documentation site](https://docs.barchart.com/alerts/#/) has been expanded, clarified, and improved.
